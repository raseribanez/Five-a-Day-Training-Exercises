# Five-a-Day-Training-Exercises
Not a healthy living plan, its a set of little exercises I do each day to practice. And there's more than 5!

The idea at first was just to have a set of between 10 or 20 little exercises that could be run through each day and used to remember and practice the basics of Python.

Nothing special really, all I do is open a Shell Window, rather than an editor, and play around with little loops and concepts. I ended up writing down a load of powerful little lines of code and practicing them now and then.

I try to cover a few of the main areas, as I want to be able to do these things quickly and easily without the need to look for information and instructions.

I started with little things like print the numbers 1 to 10 with a for loop, but show a few ways to do the same thing, and also using random to do various things. I also like the powerful string abilities that Python is amazing with. Like reversing strings, displaying certain things from a string sequence, concatenation and rearranging.

The things I am covering here are what I used to find very boring and skip over, now I love being able to do these things off the top of my head. When I first started learning Python (and for a long while after) I was more fascinated with running codes I would find that did cool things, like games and the like. If I did a tutorial I would skip right over the 'Strings' and 'Loops' sections to find the good stuff. Now I get more satisfaction from those smaller things than I ever did before. I feel like by learning these areas I am learning the mechanics of how Pythin works.

I will also add in a few things that stemmed from a book I am writing, in which there is a section called 'Proving the Power of Python' which is cheesy I know, but what it demonstrates is how to do a Lot with a Little - things like File operations, Webbrowser and other things that come pre-installed with Python (so need NO extras). Anything I find usefulwill get added. And the idea is for them to be short and sweet. A few lines of code that do a Lot later on.
